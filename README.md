## TODO:

- Hide caret after incorrect entry
- Show list of key bindings at bottom when not typing
- In learning mode, after an incorrect entry, make the digit on the right side of the caret go red so the user practices typing it
- Prevent score being added if the user changes from learning mode to normal at the end of an attempt
